Contributing to the project and the format for doing so is explained in the next section.

## Contributing

### Expectations

As a contributor, you are expected to maintain a helpful attitude when committing changes or recieving feedback.  Every contributer knows that your submissions represent time and effort on your part, and your commits will _never_ be reverted without discussion or explanation by _any contributor_ except the owner of the repository at his discretion.  

### Commit Message Formatting

Your commit message should have three elements: a suitable title, a description of the changes, and a specified author.  GitHub clients usually format the author (which is the individual or group of people responsible for writing the code submitted), so I will only cover the other two below.

#### A Suitable Title

Commit titles are always difficult to write.  Try to include these elements:

* The names of the changed files
* A brief statement of improvements (i.e. 'fixed bugs' or 'added features')

Use the tag [ME] at the beginning of the title to indicate a 'Minor Edit' of less than five lines changed/added.

#### Description of Changes

The description is very important for debugging and assigning 'blame' for an individual issue or problematic addition within the code.  Your commit description should include a statement of each file changed (as appropriate) with a summary of the intent and scope of your changes, as well as any problems that they solve.  Here is a good example:

> CONTRIBUTING.md - Filled in text with contributing guidelines and expectations; added periods where necessary in bulleted list
> index.html - Fixed image placement bug

### Notification of Content Submission

When you contribute large amounts of code or add new files, notify your teammates on the [Google forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zfjames) so that everyone knows what's going on (well, probably).

With appreciation,

zfJames
